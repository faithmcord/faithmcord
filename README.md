- Hi, I am Faith (@faithmcord). 
- I am really into baking but I have honestly wayyy too many hobbies and get distracted really easily.
- I am currently majoring in Computer Science - software development with a minor in cybersecurity 
but I am meeting with my advisor to possibly add more to my degree audit.
- I also really enjoy D&D and board games!
